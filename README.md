# React Native MobX Demo

This app (RNMB) demonstrates a simple use case for React Native and MobX.

The app shows real-world schedules for [GO Transit](http://www.gotransit.com/) trains departing
in the next 30 minutes from Toronto Union Station. The times are scheduled rather than realtime,
and they are provided by the [Transitland API](https://transit.land/).

The code is licensed per MIT (to be confirmed).


## Purpose

RNMB (React Native MobX Demo) shows a simple, but realistic, use case for an app made with
React Native and MobX. We wanted to demonstrate how the "best practices" used
at [Evenset](http://evenset.com/) look in a realistic situation,
rather than simply describing what we do.

We use this sample app as the starting point for full projects, and we invite you to do the same.
Furthermore, we welcome your feedback and suggestions for improvement.


## Development

Just start the thing.


## Production

Please don't.
